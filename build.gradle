/* ============================================================================
 * Build file for project 'CI-CD_EchoServerBE'
 * ============================================================================
 * This file was initial generated by EGradle
 * using 'Basic single gradle project (Java)' template
 * 
 * This is a very basic template suitable for gradle beginners and is nearly the
 * same as done by Gradle 'init' task. This generated file contains a sample 
 * Java project to get you started. In addition it will setup all necessary
 * eclipse parts also, so an out of the box import is possible.
 *
 * For more details about the java parts take a look at the Java Quickstart 
 * chapter in the Gradle user guide available at 
 * https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_java_projects.html
